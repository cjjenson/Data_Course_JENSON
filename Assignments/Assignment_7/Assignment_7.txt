1.  Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.

According to the ANOVA model, Nitrogen and Temperature was not significant. They had an F Value of 0.204 and 3.392 respectfully. However, it is when these variables are taken in connection with other variables that they become significant. 

2. In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships? If so, do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with this in R

When we examine the relationship between growth rate and nitrogen it could have a parabola type relationship. In order to deal explore this relationship, we would have to specify what type of relationship and an equation dealing with y = ax^2 + mx + b instead of y=mx + b.
